# Neural combinatorial optimization with reinforcement learning

Use `uv` with the given `pyproject.toml` to setup the Python environment for this project.

The simulated annealing experiments are in the `tsp-sa-110625.iypnb` Jupyter notebook.

The training code for the neural networks are in `robot.py.`

The datasets are in `data/tsp`, with Google drive links in `data/links.txt` to download the datasets.

All baseline code for the classical solvers are in the `baselines/` folder.
